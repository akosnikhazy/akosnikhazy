    <p>Finally I finished Yakuza 3 remastered. It was strange to go back to older graphics after Kiwami 2, but it still holds up!</p>
    <p>I put the statistics here because I find it funny I managed to do two 100s in it, also didn't even knew I have to gain Haruka's trust. I do not know what it is about.</p>
    <p>After the story I done some fun achievements too, but I am sure as hell I will not get 100%. It is just a pointless grind in Yakuza games. Lets say I like Mahjong... but not like this. Also dating with all the hosts for the substory complation is simply too much bother.</p>
