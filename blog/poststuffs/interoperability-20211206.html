    <p>
    Last week I had the opportunity to learn about Interoperability of IT systems in the EU. The course was full of useful information about how other countries built their systems around this topic, what problems they faced doing it. </p>
   
     <p>
     As the EU brings countries closer and closer to each other, more and more systems have to work together, and this is a huge task for every country. Every country makes their own legal framework for this, but on technical level they have to work on the same language.
     </p>
     
     <p>
     I will not write more about this though. It is such a big topic, affects so many organizations and systems that a week I learned about it was only scratching the surface of this topic. But there are well written resources about it online. Like <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/14/interoperability-between-eu-information-systems-council-adopts-regulations/">this</a>. And <a href="https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Activities/Security/Implemented-Security-Measures-And-Control-Mechanisms">this</a>.
