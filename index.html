			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			
			<p>You are here because you clicked on a link on other places, or one of the search engines indexed this, and found it relevant for your search query. I am happy you are here!</p>
			
			<p>I am Ákos Nikházy, a Hungarian developer. This is my super low-budget<sup><a href="#one">[1]</a></sup> page I maintain so I have a place to link all my slightly relevant stuff around the internet.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h2>Professional links</h2>
			
			<p>This part of this low-budget site is for links that show my professional stuff, but they are updated rarely and mostly not represent my present knowledge as most work I do is confidential to the workplace<sup><a href="#two">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/akosnikhazy">My GitHub</a> profile is for my code. I put stuff there for safekeeping. They were good when I made them, but I do not maintain them anymore. Feel free to change them, build on them... etc.</li>
			
				<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/559110/%C3%81kos-nikh%C3%A1zy">My Stack Overflow</a> profile is for my dumb questions. I celebrate the idea that it is better to ask a dumb question than stay dumb. I use it rarely though.</li>
			
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A1kosnikh%C3%A1zy/">My Linked In</a> profile is for show. I do not partake in any networking there, but keep up my CV. Might answer messages there.</li>
			
				<li><a href="mailto:nikhazy.akos@gmail.com">My email</a> where you can contact me. "Don't put you email in the code, bots will use it for spam!" This address is so old, I don't care if another bot captures it here. If you write me it will not go to spam anyway. I will most likely answer!</li>
			</ul>
				
			<h2>Hobby links</h2>
			
			<p>These are links that are connected to my free time in the digital space. My offline hobbies such as cooking, hiking, reading books, 3D printing models and other cliche are staying offline<sup><a href="#three">[3]</a></sup></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>My <a href="https://instagram.com/yzahkin">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nakos">dA</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AkosNikhazyPhotography">FB Page</a> are all for sharing my photography and other static visual stuff I create. It is random when and what content I produce.</li>
				
				<li>I have this <a href="https://twitter.com/nikhazyakos">Twitter</a> too. It is mixed with updates about my code, my projects and gaming.</li>
				
				<li>On <a href="https://sketchfab.com/Yzahkin">Sketchfab</a> I keep my 3D work. I am not really that good at it but enjoy making models sometimes.</li>
			
				<li>Also I play video games on bunch of different platforms. I record my silly <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/gamer/Yzahkin">achievements</a> on Xbox, and <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/gamer/yzahkin">trophies</a> on PS. I aim for 100% but almost never do it, because I respect my time. Yet it is fun to try.</li>

			<p><sup id="one">[1]</sup> Low-budget on many levels. I use this domain, as I own it for years to come. Also I use GitHub as server, so it is free. Not to speak about the fact this page doesn't have JavaScript in it, not even CSS. Pure HTML, works on every browser, it is fast, and you can read it. This is not a statement, I love CSS and having fun building <a href="https://akosnikhazy.github.io/self-contained-encrypter1.1/">interesting stuff with JavaScript</a>. But here it doesn't felt like doing more would be more. It works. It is practical. It is fast.</p>
			<p><sup id="two">[2]</sup> When I working for a company I will not disclose any software that I am banned from disclosing. It is an important thing. Still I publish code born on job when I can.</p>
			<p><sup id="three">[3]</sup> On the other hand I could link my IMDB movie watch list, also my moly.hu reading list, as these are online representations of my offline hobbies. But I will not. They are not that important. You can find them if you are very interested.</p>
