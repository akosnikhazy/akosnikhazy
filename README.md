### Welcome to my GitHub!

Here I share code I worked on for whatever reason. [Snippets](https://github.com/akosnikhazy/snippets) from [hobby projects](https://github.com/akosnikhazy/self-contained-encrypter1.1) and [work](https://github.com/akosnikhazy/Android-Google-Maps-Custom-Pathfinder). I do not maintain these; feel free to build on them, make them better. I really just put them here so they are out of my system.

If you have any questions about my stuff, need help using them, feel free to contact me at nikhazyakos üêö proton ‚Ä¢ me. I tend to answer emails in a day or so.

This repository also acts as a server for my domain [yzahk.in](https://yzahk.in). I put my links on it and change the whole thing from time to time. Now it is about my game development journey! Check it out!
