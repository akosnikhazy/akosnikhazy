### Welcome to my GitHub!

Here I share code I worked on for whatever reason. Snippets from hobby projects and work. I do not maintain these, feel free to build on them, make them better, I really just put them here so they are out of my system.

If you have any questions about my stuff, need help using them, feel free to contact me at nikhazy.akos at gmail. I tend to answer emails in a day or so.
